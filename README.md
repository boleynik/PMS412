for the assignment due Feb 18, all we need to do is create the classes required for our 5 use cases (no minimum, but we need to represent the entire system) 
and _define_ (not implement) the APIs (public methods) that will be used and document them with JavaDocs. Also need the HTML file, class assessment(?), and group contributions. 

ben contribution: created repo, created packages and classes
